# iUML_B_SCXML
SCXML iUML-B Rodin integration

This repository was used during the intial development of the SCXML/iUML-B/Event-B developments.
It has now been split into 3 separate repositories SCXML_EMF, SCXML_EVENTB and SCXML_SIRIUS. 
Please use these 3 repositories instead which are on eventb-soton.

See also iUML_B_SCXML_old_plugin - this contains the first version of the SCXML to 
iUML-B translation that did not support run to completion. This repository is also archived
and discontinued.
